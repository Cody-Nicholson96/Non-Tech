#Rational Persuasiveness

To say that an argument is rationally persuasive for a person (at a time) is to say:

- The argument is either deductively valid or inductively forceful

- The person reasonably believes the argument's premises (at the time)

- It is not an inductively forceful argument that is defeated for that person (at that time)

***

There are seven further points to bear in mind about Rational Persuasiveness:

1. It is not possible for the conclusion of a deductively valid argument to be defeated by a person's total evidence. This is only possible for inductively forceful arguments

2. Rationaly persuasive arugments do not need to be sound because the notion of rational persuasiveness is intended to capture what it is about an arument that consitutes its rational claim on a person

3. An attempt at persuasion by argument is an attempt at rational persuasion, as opposed to other types of persuation, which do not appeal to your reason but instead appeal to your emotions or prejudices

4. Rational persuasiveness is a matter of degree, not true/false

5. A rationally persuasive argument may fail to persuade anyone

6. Judgements about rational persuasiveness very frequently depend on estimates of the legitimacy of the suthority behind certain propositions

7. In saying that an argument is rationally persuasive for a person only if the person reasonably believes the premises, we are not requiring that the person have at his or her disposal furthur arguments with those premises as conclusions
