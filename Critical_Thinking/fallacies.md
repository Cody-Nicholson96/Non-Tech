# Fallacies

The term 'Fallacy' encompasses certain commonly encountered failures or argumentation

***

## Formal fallacies

Formal fallacies are simply logical mistakes; that is, arguments the fail to be valid of inductively forceful

-

#### Some examples of logical mistakes are:

- Affirming the consequent of a conditional (If P then Q, Q, Therefore P)

- Denying the Antecedent (If P then Q, not P, Therefore Not Q)

- Dysfunctional Syllogism (Either P or Q, Q, Therefore Not P)

- Illegitimate Syllogism (If P then Q, If R then Q, Therefore If P then R)

- Conversion (If P then Q, Therefore If Q then P)

-

### Deriving "Ought" from "Is" Fallacy:

A prescriptive conclusion cannot be validly derived from purely descriptive premises because such an inference is fallacious

Prescriptive Conclusion - A conclusion making a claim about something that should or ought to be done/avoided or believed/not-believed

Example of an argument with this fallacy:

> How can anyone claim that the monarchy should be abolished? The monarchy as we know it has been central to British life for nearly a thousand years.

You could reconstruct this in standard form to be:

```
P1) The British monarchy has existed for nearly a thousand years. (Descriptive Claim)
P2) Anything that has existed for nearly a thousand years **should** be retained. (Prescriptive Claim, Deductively Unsound because poverty has existed for nearly a thousand years)
_____________________________
C) The British Monarchy should be retained. (Prescriptive Conclusion)
```

-

### The Base Rate Fallacy

When the proposition of one group that has a certain feature is higher than the proposition of another group that has that feature in an argument

Example of base rate fallacy in an argument in standard form:

```
P1) Most people of race X have a criminal record
P2) Few non-race-X people have a criminal record
P3) Joe has a criminal record
______________
C) Joe is probably of race X
```

This argument is not inductively forceful because it does not tell you the amount of race-X people in the population. If the population of people is 10000, and of those 10000 only 10 people are of race-X, then the argument falls apart because Joe is probably not part of race-X.

***

## Substantive (Or Informal) Fallacies

Substantive (Or informal) Fallacies are arguments that implicitly assume some general premise which can be seen to be false

-

### The Fallacy of Majority Belief

Example of an argument with this fallacy in standard form:

```
P1) Most reasonable, law-abiding people believe that the government should crack down on identity theft
__________________
C) The government should crack down on identity theft
```

You can reconstruct this to say:

```
P1) Most reasonable, law-abiding people believe that the government should crack down on identity theft
P2) any belief shared by most reasonable, law-abiding people is true (Implicit premise)
___________
C) The government should crack down on identity theft
```

Just because a group of people believe something does not make it right

Once we add the implicit premise the argument becomes invalid since that premise is not always true

-

### Common Practice Fallacy

This is an attempt to persuade someone to do something they shouldn't by giving them the justification that "Everyone does it"

Example argument in standard form:

```
P1) Everyone falsifies their expenses occasionally
__________
C) It is acceptable to cheat on one's expenses occasionally
```

This could be reconstructed as:

```
P1) Everyone cheats on their expenses occasionally
P2) An act that everyone occasionally performs is acceptable
__________
C) Cheating on your expenses is acceptable
```

There are an infinite amount of examples that disprove P2 in this argument, which ultimately makes it invalid

-

### The Gambler's Fallacy (Monte Carlo Fallacy/Fallacy of the Maturity choices)

The gambler's fallacy stems from a misunderstanding of the factors that can influence probability

Example Argument:

> I buy five raffle tickets at the fair every year and I never win anything, but I am not giving up. It must be about time for my luck to change, so I'm definitely getting my five tickets this year.

First reconstruction in standard form:

```
P1) I buy raffle tickets every year
P2) I never win
______
C) I'm going to buy five tickets again this year
```

The above reconstruction does not demonstrate the faulty reasoning at work, so we reconstruct further:

```
P1) I buy raffle tickets every year
P2) I never win
P3) Not winning anything for a long time makes it more likely that I will win this time
P4) If my chances of winning have increased, it makes sense to buy more tickets this year
______
C) I'm going to buy five tickets again this year
```

Now we can see clearly that the false assumption made in P3 makes this argument invalid

-

### Ad Hominem (To the man) Fallacy

This fallacy can be committed in two ways: either by responding to someone's argument by making an attack upon that person rather than addressing the argument itself, or by rejecting a claim because of disapproval of dislike of the person who made it

Example argument:

> Jill says we should ban fracking, but what does she know! She is a part of the horrible Green Party!

The reconstruction of this argument in standard form would look like this:

```
P1) Jill wants to ban fracking
P2) Jill is a part of the Green party
___________
C) We should not ban fracking
```

We can take that further to say:

```
P1) Jill wants to legislate to ban fracking
P2) Jill is a member of the Green party
P3) Legislation proposed by the Green party should never be passed
___________
C) We should not legislate to ban fracking
```

This argument is clearly invalid because the claim made in P3 makes the argument invalid

-

### Ad Hominem (To the man) Circumstantial Fallacy

This fallacy is a subset of the Ad Hominem fallacy that is committed when an argument is discredited because it will benefit the person making the argument

Example argument:

> Of course academics argue in favor of the purposed expansion of university education: the more aspiring graduates there are, the more job opportunities there are for people like them.

Reconstruct in standard form:

```
P1) Academics argue in favor of the expansion of university education
P2) The more aspiring grads there are, the more job opportunities there are for people like them
____________
C) We should reject arguments in favor of expanding university education
```

This reconstruction is neither valid nor inductively forceful, so we reconstruct again:

```
P1) Academics argue in favor of the expansion of university education
P2) They would benefit from such an expansion
P3) Whenever someone would benefit from something they propose, we should reject their arguments in favor of it
________________
C) We should reject academics' arguments in favor of the proposal to expand the university
```

Now we can clearly see the fallacy at work in P3, making this argument invalid

-

### Tu Quoque ("You Too") Fallacy

This fallacy occurs when we make unwarranted connections between a person's alleged lack of credibility and the strength of their argument

Example Argument:

> My Dad always tells me not to text and drive, but why should I listen? He is always taking calls when he's driving.

Initial reconstructions:

```
P1) My Dad says people shouldn't talk on the phone while driving
P2) My Dad talks on the phone while driving
_____________
C) It is OK to talk on the phone when driving
```

The below reconstruction captures the fault:

```
P1) My Dad says people shouldn't talk on the phone while driving
P2) My Dad talks on the phone while driving
P3) Whenever someone's behavior is inconsistent with their advice, that advise is false
_____________
C) It is OK to talk on the phone when driving
```

This argument is not sound because there are many situations where P3 could be false

-

### Appeal to Authority

This fallacy is committed when an argument makes an unjustified appeal to an alleged authority

Example argument:

> Bob has brewed whisky for 30 years and today he called today and said that alcohol education should be introduced to kids as young as five. With all those years in the industry, Bob must know what he is talking about.

The initial construction shows that this is valid:

```
P1) Bob says that alcohol education should be introduced to kids as young as 5
P2) Bob has 30 years' experience as a whisky brewer
P3) If someone has 30 years' experience as a whisky brewer, they must be an expert in alcohol education
P4) If someone is an expert in a subject we should accept their opinion on it
_______________
C) Alcohol education should be introduced to kids as young as 5
```

However, this argument is unsound because of the falsity of the condition P3. Just having 30 years experience as a brewer doesn't mean that they know everything about alcohol.

-

### The Perfectionist Fallacy

This fallacy occurs when we place excessive demands on an idea or a proposal and then reject it purely on the grounds that it will not **completely** solve a problem

> World leaders should give up their plans to spend billions of dollars on rescuing the financial market. It would take trillions of dollars to fix the mess, the amount they are talking about will only partially solve the serious problems we face.

An initial reconstructions shows that the argument is invalid:

```
P1) Would leaders' proposals to cut carbon emissions by 20% will not solve the problem of climate change completely
___________
C) We should reject world leaders' proposals to cut carbon emissions
```

When we include the perfectionist premise we see that this argument is inductively unsound because the perfectionist premise (P2) is wrong:

```
P1) Would leaders' proposals to spend billions of dollars to rescue financial markets will not solve the problems completely
P2) If the proposed solution will not solve the problem completely it should be rejected
___________
C) We should reject world leaders' proposals to cut carbon emissions
```

-

### Conflation of Morality with Legality

This fallacy is made when we make the assumption that anything that is legal is moral and that anything illegal is immoral, or vice versa

Example argument:

> It's not immoral to dress provocatively and swear in front of pre-teens. After all, it's not illegal.

In our initial reconstruction we can see that this argument is invalid:

```
P1) Some singers dress provocatively and swear in front of audiences of pre-teens
P2) It is not illegal to do this
_____________
C) Dressing provocatively and swearing in front of pre-teens is not immoral
```

In our final reconstruction we can see the fallacy at work in P3:

```
P1) Some singers dress provocatively and swear in front of audiences of pre-teens
P2) It is not illegal to do this
P3) Anything legal is moral
_____________
C) Dressing provocatively and swearing in front of pre-teens is not immoral
```

-

### Weak Analogy

This fallacy is made when the analogy is too weak to sustain the argument or because the analogy itself has not been argued for.

Example argument with this fallacy:

> I don't see what all the fuss is about guns. Of course guns shouldn't be prohibited, you can kill someone with a hockey stick, but no one proposes to ban ownership of hockey sticks.

The reconstruction of this argument shows the weak analogy:

```
P1) Guns are like hockey sticks in that both can kill people
P2) Whenever an object X is similar to an object Y in one respect, it is similar in all respects
P3) Objects that are similar in all respects should be treated identically
P4) We would not ban ownership of hockey sticks
____________
C) We should not ban ownership of guns
```

This argument is unsound because it is false to assume that similarity in one respect implies similarity in all respects (The Weak Analogy Fallacy)

-

### Causal Fallacies

These fallacies are committed when we mistake inferences about the causes of something

Three types of this fallacy can be identified:

- Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (After that, this, therefore this because of that)

- The fallacy of mistaking correlation for cause

- Inversion of cause and effect

-

### After that, this, therefore this because of that

This fallacy occurs when we mistakenly infer that an event X caused an event Y merely on the basis that Y occurred after X

Example argument with this fallacy:

> Generally, people who write wills live longer than those who don't. Probably, making a will causes people to live longer

The reconstruction of that argument:

```
P1) Generally, people who write wills live longer than those who don't.
P2) Whenever one event X occurs after an event Y, X causes Y
P3) Living longer occurs after making a will
______________
C) Probably, making a will causes people to live longer
```

This is inductively forceful but unsound because of P2

-

### The fallacy of mistaking correlation for cause

This fallacy is committed when a statistical correlation is assumed, without any further justification, to establish a casual relation

Example Argument with fallacy:

> You only have to look at the statistics to see that poverty is caused by educational under-achievement. 80% of those who leave school with no qualifications come from homes whose income is at least 50% below the national average.

The initial reconstruction looks like this:

```
P1) There is a statistical correlation between poverty and educational under-achievement
_____________
C) Poverty causes educational under-achievement
```

By making explicit the hidden assumption, we derive the following valid but unsound argument:

```
P1) There is a statistical correlation between poverty and educational under-achievement
P2) Whenever two phenomena X and Y are correlated, X is the cause of Y
_____________
C) Poverty causes educational under-achievement
```

-

### Inversion of cause and effect

In this fallacy one mistakenly infers that if X causes Y, an absence of X will prevent Y

Just because X causes Y does not mean that ~X will cause ~Y

***

## Epistemic Fallacies

### Appeal to Ignorance

This is the fallacy of concluding either that because a claim has not been proven it must be false (Negative form), or that because it has not been disproved it must be true (Positive form)

Example in argument with fallacy in negative form:

> No one has proved that UFOs exist, so it is reasonable to say that they don't

Same example in positive form:

> No one has managed to prove that UFOs don't exist, so we can reasonably say that they do

Both of these statements are equally fallacious

-

### Epistemic (Knowledge) Fallacy

This fallacy arises because of the tricky nature of knowledge and belief, and the difficulty of discerning from the third-person point of view what someone knows or believes

Example argument with fallacy:

> Chris believes that the US president enjoys basketball. Barack Obama is the US president, so Chris believes that Obama likes basketball

A reconstruction gives us:

```
P1) Chris believes that the US president enjoys basketball
P2) Obama is the US President
________
C) Chris believes that Obama enjoys basketball
```

This argument is invalid because the arguer has assumed that Chris knows that Obama is president

The below argument is valid, however, because what we know and believe is not in question:

```
P1) The US first lady planted a garden
P2) Michelle is the US first lady
______
C) Michelle planted a garden
```

***

## Fallacy Argument Techniques

### Equivocation

When we deliberately use a word or form of words with the intention to confuse the audience in hopes that the audience will conflate the two or more possible interpretations

-

### Red Herring

This technique is used to throw someone off the scent of one's argument by distracting them with an irrelevance

-

### Slippery Slope

This technique is employed when an arguer wrongly assumes that to permit a course of action will inevitably lead to the occurrence of further related and undesirable events - without providing good reasons to suppose that the further events will indeed inevitably follow. Thus, the first event will undoubtedly lead to the others.

-

### Straw Man

This is a technique used when an arguer ignores their opponent's real position on an issue and sets up a weaker version of that position by misrepresentation, exaggeration, distortion, or simplification. This makes their opponents argument easier to defeat.

-

### Begging the Question

An argument commits this fallacy when the truth of its conclusion is assumed by one or more of its premises, and the truth of the premises depend for their justification on the truth of the conclusion

-

### False Dilemma

This is the technique of limiting consideration of positions on an issue to fewer alternatives than are actually available to be considered. The arguer pretends that there are only two options and then makes sure that one of them is more appealing.
