# Conditionals

Conditionals are "If" statements

Example:

If it is raining, then is is cloudy

-

The "If" side of the statement is called the Antecedent, and is the sufficient condition

The "Then" side of the statement is called the Consequent, and is the necessary condition

In this example, it must be cloudy for it to rain because "it is cloudy" is the necessary condition

However, it can be cloudy without it raining because "is is raining" is the sufficient condition
