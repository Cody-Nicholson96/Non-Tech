#Generalisation

A proposition concerning a class of things involving a quantifier

Example:

"Every dog is black", "Some snails are slow"

***

###Gerneralisations can be hard or soft
-

Hard generalisations can be conveyed by using a quantifier-word like 'all', 'no', or 'every'

For example:

Someone at a meeting of Parliament might say, 'Every single MP in this chamber takes bribes', rather than 'The MPs in this chamber take bribes'

-

Soft Generalisations are very often expressed without any quantifier at all, as in 'Children like sweeties'

Other times, we add a quantifier such as 'most', or 'almost all' to a soft generalisation, in order to make it clear that a soft generalisation is what is intended, and also to make it clear just how soft (or how close to being hard) it is meant to be
