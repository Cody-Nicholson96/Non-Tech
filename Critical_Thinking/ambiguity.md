# Ambiguity

### Lexical Ambiguity
-

When a statement could have multiple meaning bases on the words used

Example:

"I am looking for a match" is lexically ambiguous because "match" could mean a sports match, a significant other, a match to lite a fire, etc

-

### Syntactical Ambiguity
-

A sentence is Syntactically Ambiguous when the scope of the sentence is undefined

Example:

"Strong men and women can apply" could mean "Strong men" and "women", or it could mean "Strong men" and "Strong women" because the scope is undefined
