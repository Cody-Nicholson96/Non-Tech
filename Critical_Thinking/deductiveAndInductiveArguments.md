# Deductive Arguments and Inductive Arguments

Two different ways to make an inference

***

### Deductive Arguments
-

An argument that makes it so that the conclusion **has to** follow the premise

To identify a Deductive Argument, ask yourself if the claims are certain

Example:

**All** humans are mortal. You are a human. Therefore, you are mortal.

-

A Deductive Argument is Valid if it would be impossible for its premises to be true but its conclusion to be false

A Deductive Argument is Sound if it's premises are all true and it is valid

***

### Inductive Arguments
-

An argument where the conclusion probably follows the premise

Example:

**Most** humans are mortal. You are Human. Therefore, you are mortal.

-

An Inductive Argument is Forceful if its premises are true the but its conclusion is false

An Inductive Argument is Sound if it's premises are all true and it is inductively forceful

If an Inductive Argument is sound then has **Inductive Cogency**

-

Examples of Inductive Forcefulness and Weakness:

Most cats have four legs. Garfield is a cat. Garfield probably has four legs. (Inductively Forceful, Cogent)

Few cats have four legs. Garfield is a cat. Garfield probably has four legs. (Inductively Weak, Uncogent)
