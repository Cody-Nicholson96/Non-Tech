#Economic Science

Economists are scientists studying how we allocate our scarce resources, and like scientists Economists use the **scientific method**

The **Scientific Method** is the dispassionate development and testing of theories about how the world works

-

Unlike some scientists, it is hard for Economists to test their theories because they aren't allowed to change a groups economic policies

Due to this, Economists research mostly comes from historical events that allow them to illustrate and evaluate economic theories of the present

-

Economists are forced to make assumptions in their studies because they never have the ability to test their theories

Assumptions are very important in the creation of economic models

-

###Economic Models

Economists create models to simplify reality to improve our understanding of it

The **Circular-Flow Diagram** simplifies the economy into only two types of decision makers - households and firms

This diagram is useful to keep in mind when thinking about how the pieces of the economy fit together

-

The **Production Possibilities Frontier** is a graph that shows the various combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology that firms use

An outcome is said to be **efficient** if the economy is getting all it can from the scarce resources it has available, and **inefficient** if it is not
