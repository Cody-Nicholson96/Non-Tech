#Cause & Effect

When you see a graph used to support an argument about cause and effect, it is important to ask whether the movements of an omitted variable could explain the results you see

If these omitted variables do have an effect on the graph, then the graph may not support the argument as well as it may appear

###Reverse Causality

An example of **Reverse Causality** is that larger families tend to have minivans - and if you displayed this on a graph you might say that minivans cause larger families when in fact it is the other way around

Often, people change their behavior not in response to a change in their present condition but in response to a change in their expectations of future conditions

This is an example of a casual conclusion that a person might make after seeing a graph
