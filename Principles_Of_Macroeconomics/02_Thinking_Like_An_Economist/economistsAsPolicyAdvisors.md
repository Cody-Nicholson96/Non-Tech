# Economists As Policy Advisers

**Positive Statements** are claims that attempt to describe the world as it is

Example: "Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment"

-

**Normative Statements** are claims that attempt to prescribe how the world should be

Example: "The government should raise the minimum wage"

***

Economists all have different hypotheses on what will work, so they often disagree

Since they are limited in their abilities to test their theories, disagreement happens frequently

No one has a perfect solution
