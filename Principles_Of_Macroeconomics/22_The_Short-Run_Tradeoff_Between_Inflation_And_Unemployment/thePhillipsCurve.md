#The Phillips Curve

The **Phillips Curve** shows the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment

More specifically, it shows the combinations of inflation and unemployment that arise in the short-run as shifts in the aggregate-demand curve move the economy along the short-run aggregate-supply curve

###Shifts in the Phillips Curve: The Role of Expectations

If a policy reduces the natural rate of unemployment, then the long-run Phillips Curve would shift left. In addition, because lower unemployment means workers are producing goods and services, the quantity of goods and services supplied would be larger at any given price level and the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift right. The Economy could then enjoy lower unemployment and higher output for any given rate of money growth and inflation.

###The Short-Run Phillips Curve

(Unemployment rate) = ((Natural rate of unemployment) -a((Actual inflation) - (Expected inflation))

There is no stable short-run Phillips curve

It is dangerous to view the Phillips Curve as a menu of options for policymakers to choose from

-

***Natural-rate hypothesis** is the claim that unemployment eventually returns to normal, or natural rate, regardless of the rate of inflation

###Shifts In The Phillips Curve: The Role of Supply Shocks

A **Supply Shock** is an event that directly alters a firms' costs and prices, shifting the economy's aggregate-supply curve and thus the Phillips Curve
