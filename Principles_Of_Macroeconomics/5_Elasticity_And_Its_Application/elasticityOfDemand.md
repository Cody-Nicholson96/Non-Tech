#Elasticity Of Demand

Goods with close substitutes tend to have more elastic demand because it is easier for consumers to switch from that good to others, like butter & margarine

By contrast, items that do not have close substitues (like Eggs) have much less elastic demand

###The Price Elasticity Of Demand

Is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good, computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price

-

###Computing The Price Elasticity Of Demand

(Price elasticity of demand) = (Percentage change in quantity demended)/(Percentage change in price)

###The Midpoint Method: A Better Way To Calculate Percentage Changes And Elastics

If you calculate the price elasticity of demand between two points on a demand curve, you will notice that elasticity between point one and point two is different from the elasticity from point two to point one

Since this is the case, if we want to get the best estimation we need to find the elasticity at the midpoint between those two points using this formula:

(((Quantity2 - Quantity1)/((Quantity2 + Quantity1)/2))/((Price2 - Price1)/(Price2 + Price1)/2))

###The Variety Of Demand Curves

*Demand is considered elastic* when the elasticity is greater than 1, which means the quantity moves proportionately more than the price

*Demand is considered in elastic* when the elasticity is less than one, meaning that the quantity moves proportionately less than the price

If elasticity is exactly 1, the percentage change in quantity equals the percentage change in price, and demand is said to have **unit elasticity**

###Total Revenue And The Price Elasticity Of Demand

The **Total Revenue** is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good, computed as the price of the good times the quantity sold

The total revenue changes as you move along the demand curve depending on the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic, then an increase in the price causes an increase in total revenue

An increase in price causes a decrease in total revenue

- When demand is inelastic price and total revenue move in the same direction: price increases, total revenue also increases

- When demand is elastic price and total revenue move in oppisite directions: price increases then total revenue decreases

- If demand is unit elastic total revenue remains constant when the price changes

###Elasticity And Total Revenue Along A Linear Demand Curve

Slope is defined as "rise over run", which here is the ratio of the change in price (rise) to the change in quantity (run)

-

###Other Demand Elastics

The **income elasticity of demand** is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in customers' income, computed as a percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income

(Income Elasticity of Demand) = (Percentage change in quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in income)

The **cross-price elasticity of demand** is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good, computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded of the first good divided by the percentage change in price of the second good

(Cross-price elasticity of demand) = (Percentage change in quantity demanded of good 1)/(Percentage change in the price of good 2)
