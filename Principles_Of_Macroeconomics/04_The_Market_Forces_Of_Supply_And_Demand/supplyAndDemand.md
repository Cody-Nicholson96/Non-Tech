# Supply And Demand

**Supply & Demand** are the forces that make market economies work, they determine the quantity of each good produced, and the price at which it is sold

If you want to know how any event or policy will affect the economy, you must first think about how it will affect supply and demand

***

**Equilibrium ** is a situation in which the market price has reached the level at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded

**Equilibrium Price** is the price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded

**Equilibrium Quantity** is the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price

**Surplus** is a situation in which quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded

**Shortage** is a situation in which quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied

**Law of supply and demand** is the claim that the price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded for that good into balance
