# Demand

The **Quantity Demanded** is the amount of a good that buyers are willing and able to purchase

The **Law Of Demand** is the claim that the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises

The **Demand Schedule** is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded

The **Demand Curve** is a graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded

**Market Demand** is the sum of all the individual demands for a particular good or service

If the demand curve shifts right it is called an **increase in demand**, and left is a **decrease in demand**

If the demand for a good falls when the income falls, the good is called a **normal good**

If the demand for a good rises when the income falls, the good is called an **inferior good**

When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called **substitutes** (Hamburgers and hot dogs, sweaters and sweatshirts, movie tickets and DVD rentals)

When a fall in the price of one good raises demand for another good, the two goods are called **complements** (gasoline and cars, computers and software, peanut butter and jelly)

#### The demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded of a good when its price caries, holding constant all other variables the influence buyers
