# Competitive Market

A **Market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service

The term **Competitive Market** is used to describe a market in which there are so many buyers and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact on the market price

-

In a **Perfectly Competitive market the goods offered for sale are all exactly the same and the buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price

Because buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market must accept the price that the market determines, they are called **price takers**

-

Some markets have only one seller, and this seller determines the price. Such a seller is called a **monopoly**
