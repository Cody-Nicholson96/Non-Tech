#What Is Economics?

**Economics** is the study of how society manages its scarce resources

1. Making decisions

2. Uderstanding other's decisions

3. Accounting for external forces

In the past it has meant "one who manages a household" or "a family"

Economics is not about making money - that is what business is about - Economics is about *understanding* how an economy works

***

####A household and an economy face many decisions:

- Who will work?

- What goods and how many of them should be produced?

- What resources should be used in production?

- At what **price** should the goods be sold?

***

####Society and Scarce Resources

- The management of society's resources is important because **resources are scarce**

- **Scarcity** means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot produce all the goods and services people wish to have
