# Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes

The invisible hand of the market economy can only work it's magic if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are key to a market economy

Market economies need institutions to enforce **property rights** so individuals can own and control scarce resources

A farmer won't grow food if they expect it will be stolen

***

The two reasons a government will intervene in the economy and change the allocation of resources that people would choose on their own:

#### To promote efficiency or to promote equality

To change the size of the pie, or the distribution of the pie

***

**Market Failure** refers to a situation in which the market on its own fails to produce an efficient allocation of resources

One possible cause of market failure is an **externality**, which refers to the ability of a single person or firm to unduly influence market prices

A market economy will reward people according to their ability to produce things others will pay for - A basketball player will probably make more than a chess player because people are willing to pay more money for basketball
