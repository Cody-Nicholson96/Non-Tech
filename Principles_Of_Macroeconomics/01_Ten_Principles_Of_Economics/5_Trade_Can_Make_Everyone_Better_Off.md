# Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off

Take a family of farmers for example. They have the skills and resources to produce enough food for themselves, maybe more than they need. Another family of engineers cannot create food for themselves, but they can build machinery. If these two families trade the farmers can create food more easily with the help of machinery, and the engineers can eat well by having the farmer's food.

This is applicable everywhere because it doesn't have to be just families, it can be communities, states, countries, etc. that all trade with each other so that everyone has access to what they want and need.
