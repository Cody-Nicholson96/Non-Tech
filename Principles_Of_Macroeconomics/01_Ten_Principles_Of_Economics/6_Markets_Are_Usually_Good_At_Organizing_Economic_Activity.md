#Principle 6: Markets Are Usually Good At Organizing Economic Activity

In a **Market Economy** the decisions of a centrral power are replaced by the decisions of millions of firms and households

Firms decide what to make and who to hire

Households decide which firms to work at and what to buy with their incomes

These firms and households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guide their decisions

-

Market prices reflect both the value of a good to society and the cost to society of making that good
