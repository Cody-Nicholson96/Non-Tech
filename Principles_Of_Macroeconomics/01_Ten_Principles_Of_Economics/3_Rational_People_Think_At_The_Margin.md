#Principle 3: Rational People Think At The Margin

**Rational People** are people who systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives

**Marginal Change** is a small incremental adjustment to a plan of action

-

Why is water so cheap, while diamonds are so expensive? We need water to survive, we don't need diamonds for anything.

The marginal benefit of water is very small because water is plentiful, but diamonds are rare so the marginal benefit is much more

**A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost**

The average cost of flying someone from city 1 to city 2 is $500 (for the ticket). The *marginal cost* is merely the cost of a drink and snack because that is all the airline would lose by having an extra passenger
