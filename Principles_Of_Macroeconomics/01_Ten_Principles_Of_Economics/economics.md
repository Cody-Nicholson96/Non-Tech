# Economics

**Economics** is the study of how society manages its *scarce* resources

Therefore, **Economists** study how people make decisions: what to buy, how much to work, how much to save, how to invest savings

Economists also study how people interact with each other - like how buyers and sellers together determine the price and quantity of a good

Finally, Economists analyze forces and trends that affect the economy as a whole, including the growth in average income, the fraction of the population that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising

Economics has many facets, but it is unified by several ideas, namely: **The Ten Principles of Economics**
