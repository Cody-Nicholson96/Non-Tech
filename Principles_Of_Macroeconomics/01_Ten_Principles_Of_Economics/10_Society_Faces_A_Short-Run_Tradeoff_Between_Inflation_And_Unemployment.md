# Principle 10: Society Faces A Short-Run Tradeoff Between Inflation And Unemployment

- Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level of spending and thus the demand for goods and services

- Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices but also encourages them to hire more workers to produce more goods and services

- More hiring means lower unemployment

Over a period of a year or two many economic policies push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions

The **Business Cycle** is the irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations in economic activity, as measured by the production of goods and services or the number of people employed
