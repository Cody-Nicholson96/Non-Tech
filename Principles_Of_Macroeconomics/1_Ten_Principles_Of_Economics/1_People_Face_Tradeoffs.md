#Principle 1: People Face Tradeoffs

"There is no such thing as free lunch"

To get something you want you always have to give up something. It could be time, money, etc.

###Equality Vs Efficiency

A tradeoff society faces is between Equality and Efficiency

**Efficiency** means that society is getting the maximum benefit from its scarce resources

**Equality** means that those benefits are distributed uniformly among society's members

Efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to how we divide up the pie into individual slices
