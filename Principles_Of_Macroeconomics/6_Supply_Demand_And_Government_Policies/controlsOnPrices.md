#Controls On Prices

A **price ceiling** is a legal maximum on the price which a good can be sold

A **price floor** is a legal minimum on the price which a good can be sold

-

If a price floor is below the equilibirum or a price ceiling is above it then those limits are **non-binding** since the price will not be affected by them

If a price floor is above the equilibirum or a price ceiling is below it then those limits are **binding** since the price will be affected by them

-

A price ceiling that is binding causes a **shortage** since the price is lower

A price floor that is binding causes a **surplus** since the price is high
