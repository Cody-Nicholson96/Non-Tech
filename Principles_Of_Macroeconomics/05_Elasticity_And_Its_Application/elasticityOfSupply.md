#Elasticity Of Supply

The **supply of a good is said to be elastic** if the quantity supplied responds substantially to changes in the price

The **supply of a good is said to be inelastic** if the quantity supplied responds only slightly to changes in the price

The **price elasticity of supply** is a measure of how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good, computed as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price

(Price elasticity of supply) = (Percentage change in quantity supplied)/(Percentage change in price)
