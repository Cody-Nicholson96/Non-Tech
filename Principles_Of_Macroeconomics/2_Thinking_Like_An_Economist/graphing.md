#Graphing

**Graphs** offer a way to visually express ideas that might be less clear if described with equations or words, and they provide a powerful way of finding and interpreting patterns

An effective Economist chooses the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand

###Graphs of a single variable

Graphs that represent a single variable are useful for showing how a variable changes over time or across individuals, but they are limited in how much they can tell us

Pie chart, Bar graph, Time-series graph

###Graphs Of Two Variables: The Coordinate System

Economists are often concerned with the relationship between two variables, so they need to display two variables on one graph

The **Coordinate System** makes this possible by providing you with a two-dimensional plane where that you can put **Ordered Pairs** on

An **Ordered Pair** is a pair of values, one for your first variable (x-coordinate) and one for your second one (y-coordinate)

This allows you to see how two variables relate to each other on a graph that is easy to understand

One of the most important graphs in Economics is the **Demand Curve** which traces out the effect of a good's price on the quantity of the good consumers will buy

-

Two variables on a graph are **Positively Related** if they increase together, and **Negatively Related** if one going up causes the other to go down (and vice-versa)
