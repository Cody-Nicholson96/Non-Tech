# Taxes

All governments use taxes to raise revenue for public projects

A **tax incidence** is the manner in which the burden of a tax is shared among participants in a market

### How Taxes On Sellers Affect Market Outcomes

1. The immediate impact of tax is on the sellers of a product. Since the tax is not levied on buyers, the quantity demanded at any given price is the same, thus the demand curve does not change. The tax on sellers makes the business less profitable at any given price, so it shifts the supply curve.

2. Since the tax on sellers raises the cost of producing and selling, it reduces the quantity supplied at every price. The supply curve shifts to the left (or upwards, equivalently).

3. Having determined how the supply curve shifts, we can now compare the initial and the new equilibriums. Tax reduces the size of the market since sellers sell less and buyers buy less.

- Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity of the good sold is smaller in the new equilibrium.

- Buyers and sellers share the burden of taxes. In the new equilibrium, buyers pay more for goods and sellers receive less.

### How Taxes On Buyers Affect Market Outcomes

1. The initial impact is on the demand. The supply curve is not affected because for any given price sellers have the same incentive to provide to the market. By contrast, buyers now have to pay a tax to the government (as well as the price to the sellers) whenever they buy the product. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve for the item

2. We next determine the direction of the shift. Because the tax on buyers makes buying less attractive, buyer demand a smaller quantity of the product at every price. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (of equivalently downward).

3. Having determined how the demand curve shifts, we can now see the effect of the tax by comparing the initial equilibrium and the new equilibrium

- Taxes levied on sellers and taxes levied on buyers are equivalent

### Elasticity And Tax Incidence

A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic

This is because the elasticity measures the willingness of buyers or sellers to leave the market when conditions become unfavorable

A small elasticity of demand means that buyers do not have good alternatives to consuming this particular good

A small elasticity of supply means that sellers do not have good alternatives to producing this particular good

When the good is taxed, the side of the market with fewer good alternatives is less willing to leave the market and must bear more of the burden of the tax
