# Consumer Price Index (CPI)

a measure of the overall cost of the goods and services bought by a typical customer

***

### How the CPI is Calculated

1. Fix the basket

Determine which prices are most important to the typical consumer - if consumers buy more of item 1 than item 2, item 1 is more important and has greater weight in measuring the cost of living

2. Find the prices

Find the prices of each of the goods and services in the basket at each point in time

3. Compute the basket's cost

Use the data on prices to calculate the cost of the basket of goods and services at different times

4. Choose a base year and compute the index

Once the base year is chosen, the index is calculated as follows:

Consumer Price Index = (Price of basket of goods and services in current year / price of basket in base year) * 100

5. Compute **Inflation Rate** - the percentage change in the price index from the preceding period

Inflation tare in year 2 = ((CPI in year 2 - CPI in year 1)/CPI in year 1) * 100

### Producer Price Index (PPI)

a measure of the cost of a basket of goods and services bought by firms

### Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living

1. Substitution Bias

If apples are cheaper than oranges one year, consumers will buy more apples

If apples are more expensive than oranges the next year, consumers will buy more oranges

The BLS will assume that the consumers are still buying more apples at a=the higher cost using the fixed basket and compute the cost of living as higher than usual

2. Introduction of new goods

New goods also mess up the BLS because of the idea of a fixed basket

If the basket gets more items, then consumers will buy those instead of other items

3. Unmeasured quality change

If the quality of goods deteriorates from one year to the next while its price remains the same, the value of a dollar falls because you are getting a lesser good for the same amount of money
