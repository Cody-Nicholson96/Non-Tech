#Supply

The **quantity supplied** of any good or service is the amount that sellers are willing and able to sell

The **law of supply** claims that, other than things being equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises

The **supply schedule** states that as the price rises, sellers provide a greater and greater quantity

The **supply curve** is the curve relating price and quantity supplied

When the supply curve shifts right we call it an **increase in supply**, when it shifts left we call it a **decrease in supply**

###The supply curve shows what happens to the quantity supplied of a good when its price varies, holding constant all other variables that influences sellers. When one of these variables changes the supply curve shifts.
