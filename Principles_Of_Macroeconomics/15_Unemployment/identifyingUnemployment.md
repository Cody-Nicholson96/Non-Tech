**Labor force**: The total number of workers, including both employed and the unemployed (Labor force = (Number employed + Number unemployed)

**Unemployment Rate**: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed (Unemployment rate = (Number of unemployed/Labor force) * 100)

**Natural rate of unemployment** is the normal rate of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates

**Cyclical unemployment** is the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate

**Discouraged workers** are individuals who would like to work but have given up looking for a job
