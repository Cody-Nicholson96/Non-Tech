# Explaining Short-Run Economic Fluctuations

Most economists believe that classical theory describes the world in the long run but not in the short run

### The Assumptions Of Classical Economic Fluctuations

The classical view is sometimes described as "Money is a veil". That is, nominal variables may be the first things we see when we observe an economy because economic variables are often expressed in units of money. But what's important are the real variables and the economic forces that determine them. According to the classical theory, to understand these real variables, we need to look behind the veil.

### The Reality Of Short-Run Fluctuations

Most economists believe that classical theory describes the world in the long run but not in the short run

Beyond a period of several years, changes in money supply affect prices and other nominal variables but do not affect real GDP, unemployment, or other real variables (Classical Theory)

However, when studying year-to-year changes in the economy, the assumption of monetary neutrality is no longer appropriate

In the short-run, real and nominal variables are highly intertwined, and changes in the money supply can temporarily push real GDP away from its long-run trend
