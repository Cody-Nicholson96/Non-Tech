# Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

**GDP** is the total income of a nation

**GCP** measures both the total income of everyone in the economy, and the total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services

*For the economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure*

**GDP** measures the flow of money, and we can compute it by adding up the total expenditures or by adding up the total incomes paid by firms (Since these those two numbers will be equal)
