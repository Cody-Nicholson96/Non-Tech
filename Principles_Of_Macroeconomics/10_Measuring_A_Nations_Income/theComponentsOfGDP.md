# The Components Of GDP

To understand how the economy is using its scarce resources, economics study the composition of GDP among various types of spending

To do this GDP (Y) is divided into four components: Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Purchases (G), and Net Exports (NX)

#####Y = C + I + G + NX

***

### Consumption

Spending by households on goods and services with the exception of purchases of new housing

-

### Investment

Spending on capital equipment, inventories, and structures, including household purchases of new housing

-

### Government Purchases

Spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments

-

### Net Exports

Spending on domestically produced goods by foreigners (exports) minus spending on foreign goods by domestic residents (imports)
