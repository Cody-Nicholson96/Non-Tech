# Real Vs Nominal GDP

**Real GDP** is the production of goods and services valued at *constant* prices

We calculate Real GDP by first designating one year as a *base year*

Then we use the prices of these goods and services during that year to calculate the values of those goods and services in all of the years

-

**Nominal GDP** is the production of goods and services valued at *current* prices

If the price of goods and services are different from year to year then we account for that in our calculation of the nominal GDP

-

##### Nominal GDP uses current prices to place a value on the economy's production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to place a value on the economy's production of goods and services.

### The GDP Deflater

a measure of the price level calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP times 100

GDP Deflater = (Nominal GDP/Real GDP) * 100

Since Nominal GDP and Real GDP are always the same in a given base year, the GDP Deflater for a base year is always 100

Economists use the term **inflation** to describe a situation in which the economy's overall price level is rising

The **inflation rate** is the percentage change in some measure of the price level from one period to the next

We can use the GDP deflater to calculate the inflation rate between two consecutive years is computed as follows:

Inflation rate in two years = ((GDP Deflater in year 2 - GDP Deflater in year 1) / GDP Deflater in year 1) * 100

When GDP declines it is called a **recession**
