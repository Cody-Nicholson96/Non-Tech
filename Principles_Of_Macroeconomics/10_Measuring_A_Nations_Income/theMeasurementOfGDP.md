# The Measurement Of GDP

**GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time**

### GDP is the Market Value

If the price of an apple is twice as much as the price of an orange, then an apple contributes twice as much to GDP than an orange

-

### ...of All

GDP tries to be comprehensive - it includes all items produced in the economy and sold legally in markets

GDP also includes the market value of the housing services provided by the economy's stock of housing (for renters, rent equals both the tenant's expenditure and the landlord's income)

GDP excludes some items that are difficult to measure: things sold illegaly, items that are produced and consumed at homes (like food from a garden)

-

### ...Final

GDP includes only the value of **final goods**

If International Paper makes paper and then Hallmark uses the paper to make a Greeting Card, the paper is called an **intermediate good** and the Greeting Card is called a **final good**

-

### ...Goods & services

GDP includes tangible (cars, food, cloths) and intangible goods (haircuts, concerts, doctor visits)

-

### ...Produced

GDP includes goods and services currently produced, it does not include things made in the past

A car made in 2016 that is bought in 2017 counts towards 2016 GDP not 2017 GDP

-

### ...Within a Country

GDP measures the value of production within a nation

When a Canadian citizen works temporarily in the US, their work counts toward US GDP

When a US citizen owns a factory in Haiti the production of that factory does not count towards American GDP

-

### ...in a Given Period of Time

GDP measures the value of production that takes place within a specific interval of time - usually a year of a quarter (3 months)

When the government reports quarterly GDP, it presents the data after they have been modified by a statistical procedure called **seasonal adjustment**
