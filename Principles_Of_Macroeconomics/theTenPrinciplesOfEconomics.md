#The Ten Principles Of Economics

###1: People Face Tradeoffs

To get one thing we usually have to give up another thing

Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another

#####Efficientcy Vs Equity

**Efficientcy** means society gets the most that it can from its scarce resources

**Equity** means the benefits of those resources are distributed among the members of society

***

###2: The Cost Of Something Is What You Give Up To Get It

Decisions require comparing costs and benefits of alternatives

- Whether to go to college or to work?

- Whether to study or go out on a date?

- Whether to go to class or sleep in?

The **Opportunity Cost** of an item is what you give up to obtain that item

***

###3: Rational People Think At The Margin

**Marginal Changes** are small, incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action

- Study a Masters?

- By another 1% of Apple stocks?

People make decisions by comparing costs and benefits at the margin

***

###4: People Respond To Incentives

- Marginal changes in cost or benefits motivate people to respond

- The decision to choose one alternative over another occurs when that alternative's marginal benefits exceed its marginal costs

***

###5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off

People gain from their ability to trade with one another

- Specialization is what we do best of what gives us the most money

Competition results in gains from trading

Trade allows people to specialize in what they do best

###6: Markets Are Usually A Good Way To Organize Economic Activity

A **Market Economy** is an ecoomy that allocates resources through decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services

- Householeds decide what to buy and who to work for

- Firms decide who to hire and what to produce

Adam Smith made the observation that households and firms interacting in markets act as if guided by an invisible hand

- Because households and firms look at prices when deciding what to buy and sell, they unknowingly take into account the social costs of their actions

- As a result, prices guide decision makers to reach outcomes that tend to maximize the welfare of society as a whole

***

###7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes

- **Market Failure** occurs when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently

- When the market fails (breaks down) government can intervene to promote efficiency and equity

Examples: ComEd, RCN, Monsanto

Market Failure may be caused by:

- an **externality**, which is the impact of one person or firm's actions on the well-being of a bystander

- **Market Power**, which is the ability of a single person of firm to unduly influence market prices

###8: The Standard Of Living Depends On A Contry's Production

Standard Of Living (How long we live) may be measured in two different ways:

- By comparing personal incomes

- By comparing the total market value of a nation's production (GDP)

Almost all variations in living standards are explained by differences in countries' productivities

**Productivity** is the amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker's time

***

###9: Prices Rise When The Government Prints Too Much Money

Inflation is an inrease in the overal level of prices in the ecomomy

One cause of inflation is the growth in the quality of money

When the government creates large quantities of money, the value of the money falls

***

###10: Society Faces A Short-run Tradeoff Between Inflation And Unemployment

The **Phillips Curve** illustrates the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment:

- Inflation goes down, Unemployment goes up and vice versa
