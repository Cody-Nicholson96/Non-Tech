#The Ten Principles Of Economics

###1: People Face Tradeoffs

To get one thing we usually have to give up another thing

Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another

#####Efficientcy Vs Equity

**Efficientcy** means society gets the most that it can from its scarce resources

**Equity** means the benefits of those resources are distributed among the members of society

***

###2: The Cost Of Something Is What You Give Up To Get It

Decisions require comparing costs and benefits of alternatives

- Whether to go to college or to work?

- Whether to study or go out on a date?

- Whether to go to class or sleep in?

The **Opportunity Cost** of an item is what you give up to obtain that item

***

###3: Rational People Think At The Margin

**Marginal Changes** are small, incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action

- Study a Masters?

- By another 1% of Apple stocks?

People make decisions by comparing costs and benefits at the margin

***

###4: People Respond To Incentives

- Marginal changes in cost or benefits motivate people to respond

- The decision to choose one alternative over another occurs when that alternative's marginal benefits exceed its marginal costs

***

###5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off

People gain from their ability to trade with one another

- Specialization is what we do best of what gives us the most money

Competition results in gains from trading

Trade allows people to specialize in what they do best
