#How Monetary Policy Influences Aggregate Demand

**The wealth effect**: A lower price level raises the real value of households' money holdings, which are part of their wealth. Higher wealth stimulates consumer spending and thus increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.

**The interest-rate effect**: A lower price level reduces the amount of money people want to hold. As people try to lend out their excess money holdings, the interest rate falls. The lower interest rate stimulates investment spending and thus increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.

**The exchange-rate effect**: When a lower price level reduces the interest rate, investors move some of their funds overseas in search of higher returns. This movement of funds causes the real value of the domestic currency to fall in the market for foreign-currency exchange. Domestic goods become less expensive relative to foreign goods. This change in the real exchange rate stimulates spending on net exports and thus increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.

To better understand aggregate demand, we now examine the short-run determination of interest rates in more detail

Here we develop the **theory of liquidity preference** which states that the interest rate adjusts to bring money supply and money demand into balance
