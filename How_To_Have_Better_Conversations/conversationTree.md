# The Conversation Tree

The **Conversation Tree** represents your conversation, and every branch is a direction that you can go with the conversation

Ideally, you will always be on a branch that has more option for you to take, and not on a branch that is a dead end

### Where do you go after you start a conversation?

You could have the best opening into a conversation, but where do you go from there?

To avoid this you can follow a technique called **FORD**

## FORD

If you are paying attention to the other person, you will be able to pick up on key words and ideas that you can use to branch off in your conversation tree

These key words might relate to one of the four subjects that is a part of the FORD acronym, which gives you a lot of options for different branches to jump to in your conversation

- **F**amily

- **O**ccupation

- **R**ecreation

- **D**ream
