# Confidence

Confidence brings people together - people generally want to talk to confident people

The problem with this is that is it makes it seem like confidence is some type of magic, when if fact confidence just stems from your comfort in a particular subject, which you get from your experience with that subject

**Confidence** is just knowing that you can go out and do something and be successful at it

**Fear** keeps us from being exposed to new things, which means we remain inexperienced and incompetent at doing those things, which means we will not be confident when we talk about them
