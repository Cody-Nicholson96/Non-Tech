#Don't Kill The Conversation

Being curious, paying attention, and using FORD are great way to start and maintain a good conversation *on your end*, but you also have to make sure that the conversation is alive on the other person's end too

For example, if someone asks you something you have to avoid giving them a deadend answer

Instead, give an elaborate answer that gives the other person the opportunity to branch onto a number of different subjects

-

Don't get too weird, too vulgar, too personal, or too obscure unless you really know the person

Know when to stop talking and give the other person a chance to talk - don't give a monologue
