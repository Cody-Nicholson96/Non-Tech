# Starting Conversations

There are three things you need when starting a conversations:

You need to **be curious**, you need to **pay attention**, you need to **actively listen**

***

### Be Curious

By being curious you can provide your conversation with an endless source of material since you will be asking questions and providing more to talk about

This wraps into the second skill, paying attention

-

### Paying Attention

Paying attention gives you the opportunity to be curious because if you are paying attention you will have questions about the subjects being discussed

**Being curious and paying attention all wrap into being present in a conversation**

-

#### Focus

If you are paying attention and you are curious then you are being present in the conversation, in other words: you are **focused**

Focusing on the conversation will get you out of your own head and will allow you to experience new ideas, and really be a part of a conversation instead of just a spectator of one

-

#### Starting The Conversation

By being focused doors will open for you to start a conversation

Maybe you will notice a class ring, or a shirt, or something eye catching that you want to talk about

-

### Actively Listening

Once you are engaged in the conversation **active listening** isn't just about hearing, it's about focusing and investing yourself in what they are saying so that you can get outside of your own head

That does not mean just waiting for your turn to talk, or just nodding your head to what they are saying, or trying to compete with the other person's conversation
