**Segmentation** - To be able to find objects in an image

**Morphological Image Processing** - Apply some morphological functions that will differential between objects

A digital image is a computer representation of a photograph. It consists of a an n-dimensional array of pixels.

**Low-Level interpretation**: A digital image is an array of pixel values with no meaning

**High-level interpretation**: An image is worth a thousand words. The challenge of extracting meaningful patterns from such data sets lead to the research and development in the area of multimedia data mining

**Digital Image Processing** is nothing but computer-based manipulation of digital images. It can be considered as an analog of photographic darkroom. The input to a digital image processor is an image. The output of a digital image processor is also an image. This distinction is important to remember because many computer systems deal with digital images with different goals. It consists of:

- Edge detection
- Enhancement
- Line detection
- Noise removal
- segmentation
- morphological image processing

**Digital Image Analysis** deals with the computation of image properties such as the number of objects, their locations, object areas, and other descriptors. The input of to a Digital Image Analyzer consists of an image and the output is a set of numbers representing the properties. It consists of extract features like:

- Size
- Shape
- Intensity
- Texture
