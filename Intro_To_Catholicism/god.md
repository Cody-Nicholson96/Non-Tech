# God

The creator

Not a part of the created order - God is the reason for things, not a thing itself

I use "itself" because God does not have a gender, Jesus referred to him as the Father because God is a Father-like authority/figure, not because God is a man

God is not the same as god (lower cased) - god (lower cased) refers to Zeus, Athena, etc. We call God "God" because that is the best word to describe God, not because he is a god

God represents truth, beauty, goodness, and love
