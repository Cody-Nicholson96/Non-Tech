#Jesus

Jesus interprets the Bible through his life and teachings

In Catholicism, to love someone is to recognize them as your equal - Jesus introduces to us the concept of **Love**

**God loves Jesus**, meaning that Jesus is God's equal - That is why we say that Jesus is God in Human form, and why Jesus can be the "middleman" between us and God

Jesus loves us, and we can love him and accept him as our equal since he is human - Through Jesus we can love and understand God
